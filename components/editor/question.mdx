The react-query DevIcon icon is not getting rendered. Instead I'm getting a default DevIcon icon. I have tried to troubleshoot by checking the icon library and ensuring that the necessary dependencies are installed.

Can anyone help with further suggestions or solutions? I would appreciate insights on whether I need to update the component or check compatibility issues with the version I'm using. Additionally, if someone has faced a similar issue, their experience would be valuable in resolving this problem.
